# This is a mapping of just the iso3 to iso2 country codes where the
# iso2 country code is not an exact prefix of the iso3 code
# 
# We use a subset so that we can save space in the index, so not every single USA record
# gets another string on its record
#
# - in autocomplete we need this, otherwise queries like "Beijing CN" and "Puerto Escondido MX" fail
# - in search, we don't need this because for short queries like "Beijing CN", we first 
#   query placeholder which does understand iso2s, and for longer queries with streets, slop should
#   take care of ignoring the country token
